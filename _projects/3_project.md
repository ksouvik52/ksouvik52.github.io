<p>
This research thrust focuses on exploring the next generation of AI system development, including exploring sub-quadratic model architecture and their optimized kernel development, compute-in-memory (CiM) hardware archiecture, noise-aware self-healing algoritthm-architecture co-design. Some of the research outcome of this project includes: <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11780"><b>CiMNet</b></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07000"><b>LLM performance evaluation framework</b></a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nB8foAclpo"><b>Noise-aware adaptive learning</b></a>.
