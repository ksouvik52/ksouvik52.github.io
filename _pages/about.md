I am a Research Scientist at Intel AI Labs, USA. Prior to joining I did my Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from University of Southern California. I was co-advised by Dr. Massoud Pedram (SPORT lab) and Dr. Peter A. Beerel (eessc lab). My areas of research include energy-efficient, robust, and privacy-aware centralized and distributed machine mearning for computer vision and NLP applications.
